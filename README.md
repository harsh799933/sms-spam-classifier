# SMS Spam Classifier

## Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based SMS spam classifier that categorizes messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately predict whether a message is spam or not.

---

## Features
- Text preprocessing including tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization.
- Training and evaluation of the machine learning model.
- Predicting new SMS messages as spam or ham.
- Provided as a Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and visualization.

## File Structure
- `sms-spam.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire model pipeline.
- `spam.csv`: Dataset containing SMS messages and their labels.
- `model.pkl`: Trained machine learning model saved for predictions.
- `vectorizer.pkl`: Text vectorizer used during preprocessing.
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`: Jupyter Notebook checkpoint files.
